## About Me 🚀

I’m a **Front-End Web & Mobile Developer** specializing in building **scalable, high-performance applications** with modern frameworks and technologies.  
With a strong foundation in **TypeScript**, I craft robust, maintainable codebases and deliver elegant, user-focused solutions across both web and mobile platforms.  

I excel at **turning complex ideas into intuitive digital experiences** — from responsive web apps to cross-platform mobile applications. My workflow emphasizes **clean architecture, performance optimization, security best practices, and exceptional user experience design**.

- 🔭 **Currently working on:** Advanced **Next.js** projects, cross-platform **React Native** apps with **Expo** and **NativeWind**, and contributing to open-source communities.

- 📫 **Reach me at:** [phirikoketso789@gmail.com](mailto:phirikoketso789@gmail.com)
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I often explain complex coding concepts visually — diagrams and flows come more naturally to me than walls of text.
